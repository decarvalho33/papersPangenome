In recent years, a graph pangenome was constructed
using bidirected variation graphs and Graph Genome
toolkits

in addition, many studies have shown that the
read mapping ratio, transcriptome alignment efficiency,
and the call rate of some rare and large variants can be
significantly increased by using the pan-genome as a ref-
erence:

Pangenome can identify non-reference
sequences that often belong to non-core genomes and
may have important implications for the fitness of organ-
isms. Therefore, analyzing their distribution among
individuals and the function of the included genes can
provide a better understanding of the species’ adaptation
to extreme environments
